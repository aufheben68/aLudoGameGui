# aLudoGameGui
This program is my first attempt to create a Java Swing GUI of a ludo game.

Firstly you have to input some infos about your player and then you 'll get the following screen:

Buttons are clickable and trigger predefined numbers. The dice is being repainted everytime you press it's corresponding button.
